## Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive data analysis tool that tracks and visualizes global COVID-19 trends, including cases, deaths, recoveries, and vaccinations across different countries and time periods. The analysis utilizes the Our World in Data COVID-19 dataset to provide meaningful insights about the pandemic's progression and impact worldwide.

## Project Objectives
- Import and clean COVID-19 global data
- Analyze time trends of cases, deaths, and vaccinations
- Compare metrics across countries and regions
- Create visualizations including charts and maps
- Present findings in a well-documented Jupyter Notebook

## Tools and Libraries Used
- **Python 3.7+**
- **Jupyter Notebook** - For interactive code execution and documentation
- **Pandas** - For data manipulation and analysis
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** - For static data visualization
- **Plotly Express** - For interactive choropleth maps
- **NumPy** - For numerical operations

## Data Source
This project uses the [Our World in Data COVID-19 Dataset](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data), which provides up-to-date information on COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccinations from countries around the world.

## How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Required libraries: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, numpy

### Installation
1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/covid19-global-tracker.git
cd covid19-global-tracker
```

2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

4. Open the `COVID-19 Global Data Tracker.ipynb` notebook in your browser

### Running the Analysis
- Execute all cells sequentially for a complete analysis
- The notebook is structured to follow a logical flow from data loading to visualization and insights
- All visualizations will be generated within the notebook

## Key Insights from Analysis

1. **Regional Impact Variation**: The analysis reveals significant differences in how countries have been affected by COVID-19, with some experiencing multiple severe waves while others maintained better control.

2. **Vaccination Effectiveness**: Countries with higher vaccination rates generally showed a decline in new cases and deaths after vaccination campaigns reached critical mass.

3. **Death Rate Disparities**: Death rates varied considerably between countries, potentially reflecting differences in healthcare systems, reporting methodologies, population demographics, and response strategies.

4. **Pandemic Waves**: The data visualization clearly shows how pandemic waves occurred at different times across different countries, demonstrating the global yet asynchronous nature of the pandemic.

5. **Global Recovery**: The data shows gradual improvements in most regions as vaccination campaigns progressed, though with notable disparities in vaccine access and distribution.

## Project Structure
- **COVID-19 Global Data Tracker.ipynb**: Main Jupyter notebook containing all analysis and visualizations
- **README.md**: Project documentation (this file)
- **requirements.txt**: List of Python dependencies
- **/visualizations**: Folder containing exported visualization images (optional)

## Future Improvements
- Incorporate more demographic and socioeconomic factors
- Add time-series forecasting models
- Create an interactive dashboard
- Include analysis of public health policy impacts
- Add regional sub-analysis for large countries
